This small, badly coded project is intended for parents who want their kids to keep busy. Install packages installed in requirements.txt and then run main.py to create a .docx file containing a crossword puzzle for crossing out letters. The file is going to include a drawing for filling in that was created by stable diffusion generative neural network. The words that are chosen are contained in 'wyrazy.csv' file. Feel free to change them according to what you want your kid to learn. I encourage you to choose nice words to teach kids about beauty of the world. If you want to add some pictures yourself, I recommend using other neural networks like ChatGPT to create those, then throw copy those into 'kolorowanki' directory, to have them be automatically included for randomization of content of the page.
